# EvanFodemski-Project3
Third Project for DU Bootcamp.


## Description
In this project I created a Password generator with prompts to make a unique password with all the characters that the user may or may not want. the length of the password is customizeable from 8-128 characters depending on what the user chooses. I was given the HTML and the CSS that did not require modification as well as a little bit of starter code in the javascript file, where I did all of my own coding.
